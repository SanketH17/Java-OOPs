/*
Program of the counter without static variable
In this example, we have created an instance variable named count which is incremented in the constructor. Since instance variable gets the memory at the time of object creation, each object will have the copy of the instance variable. If it is incremented, it won't reflect other objects. So each object will have the value 1 in the count variable.

class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    Counter() {
        count++;
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}

public class P02_TestStatic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        Counter c2 = new Counter();
        Counter c3 = new Counter();
    }
